# Stochastic Depth First Search-based Recursive backtracking for Maze Generation and Solving

Maze Generation and Solving is an exciting problem and countless approaches are out there for the same. The novice greedy method for solving the maze is the DFS approach, for intuition consider traveling down the path that has been already explored to the furthest, and continuing our exploration down the same path would be a rational decision to reach the destination. At the same time randomly initializing the search paths several times will allow the algorithm to be efficient overall. 

This project was aimed at achieving the following goals,

* To implement a maze generator
* To implement a maze solver

>A more significant challenge was attempting to code the tasks in a less familiar programming language (java). To add, the results of the projects must also be appealing.

The following are the results of the project,

#### Maze Generator
